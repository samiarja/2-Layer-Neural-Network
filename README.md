# A 2 Layer Neural Network
<br>

A simple neural network using only **numpy** , **time** and **Scipy**
<br>


### The target from this is to learn:


**1.** How to write a neural network from scratch.
<br>

**2.** Using Libraries as less as I can to understand the math behind the scene.
<br>

**3.** To share knowledge and discover more about Deep Learning.
